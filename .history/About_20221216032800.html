            Pizzeria is a new player in the restaurant industry.  The restaurant is in a comfortable, 
            familiar, beautiful city of Abuja that has a strong need for additional dining options.  Bolstered by the need for 
            more choices in family-oriented dining experiences, combined with the option for home-delivery, the 
            restaurant is positioned to take advantage of the market need and serve the families in the Deauville area.

          <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
          <p>
            ‘PIZZERIA’ Pizza has turned out to be prestigious for its
            tremendous, hand-hurled Neapolitan, profound dish, and
            Sicilian-style pizzas, every one of which invests some energy in a
            block lined hearth stove before touching base at your table. A few
            pies are slathered in ‘Pizzeria’ signature sauce made from
            vine-matured San Marzano tomatoes; others are finished with
            increasingly test fixings, including one that is covered underneath
            Philly steak and peppers.
